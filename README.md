# About Us
The inception of Pegasus Anticheat originated from a simple yet compelling idea: crafting a script that could discern players attempting to access our server after utilizing a spoofer. Based in Greece, I was actively involved in both playing on and developing for Greek-listed FiveM servers. Unfortunately, it was evident that cheaters in this community posed a significant challenge. However, this challenge became an opportunity for growth, as I learned from some of the best in the business 😏

While assisting friends in safeguarding their servers from cheaters, I encountered instances where certain individuals openly mocked server administrators, boasting that they could easily evade bans and swiftly return. It was during these moments that I contemplated potential solutions, leading to the inception of the Pegasus idea.

My journey began with a 1000-line server-side script, meticulously analyzing various player attributes upon connecting to the server. This script, in the end, possessed the remarkable capability to distinguish between legitimate players and hackers who had previously evaded bans on our server.

When a player connects to your server, crucial information such as their SteamHex, IP address, and license becomes available for scrutiny. Armed with this data, I was able to devise strategies to discern what spoofers attempted to accomplish. Spoiler alert: it's relatively straightforward! Spoofers aim to conceal themselves from your server to circumvent your banning techniques. So, what if you could develop a script to detect such evasive behavior? The answer was clear: yes, it was entirely feasible.

Please keep in mind that Pegasus is a powerful anticheat with many detection features. Spending enough time configuring it properly is crucial to avoid false bans. 30 minutes isn't too long to secure your server effectively.

# Q&A (Questions and Answers)
Q: Does Pegasus Anticheat Completely Stop Spoofing?  
> A: No, Pegasus can't completely stop spoofing, but it makes it much harder for cheaters to avoid bans.


Q: Do New Players Sometimes Get Incorrectly Banned?
> A: Yes and no. Whether new players get falsely banned depends on how you set up your server. You can reduce false bans by adjusting specific protection settings. In my extensive testing, out of 400 spoofing attempts, only five players got wrongly banned. This is quite rare if your server's settings match its needs.


Q: Is Pegasus Free?
> A: If you download our anticheat during the beta phase, you'll receive a lifetime key. Afterward, the licenses will be available at a very affordable price.


Q: Is it Open Source?
> A: No.
