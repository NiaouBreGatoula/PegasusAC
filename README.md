# About Us
The inception of Pegasus Anticheat originated from a simple yet compelling idea: crafting a script that could discern players attempting to access our server after utilizing a spoofer. Based in Greece, I was actively involved in both playing on and developing for Greek-listed FiveM servers. Unfortunately, it was evident that cheaters in this community posed a significant challenge. However, this challenge became an opportunity for growth, as I learned from some of the best in the business üòè

While assisting friends in safeguarding their servers from cheaters, I encountered instances where certain individuals openly mocked server administrators, boasting that they could easily evade bans and swiftly return. It was during these moments that I contemplated potential solutions, leading to the inception of the Pegasus idea.

My journey began with a 1000-line server-side script, meticulously analyzing various player attributes upon connecting to the server. This script, in the end, possessed the remarkable capability to distinguish between legitimate players and hackers who had previously evaded bans on our server.

When a player connects to your server, crucial information such as their SteamHex, IP address, and license becomes available for scrutiny. Armed with this data, I was able to devise strategies to discern what spoofers attempted to accomplish. Spoiler alert: it's relatively straightforward! Spoofers aim to conceal themselves from your server to circumvent your banning techniques. So, what if you could develop a script to detect such evasive behavior? The answer was clear: yes, it was entirely feasible.

# Q&A (Questions and Answers)
Q: Does Pegasus Completely Stop Spoofing?  
> A: No, Pegasus can't completely stop spoofing, but it makes it much harder for cheaters to avoid bans.


Q: Do New Players Sometimes Get Incorrectly Banned for Spoofing?
> A: Yes and no. Whether new players get falsely banned depends on how you set up your server. You can reduce false bans by adjusting specific protection settings. In my extensive testing, out of 400 spoofing attempts, only five players got wrongly banned. This is quite rare if your server's settings match its needs. However you can always whitelist and allow these 5 player's eventually to connect to your server.

Q: Does PegasusAC receive updates?
> A: Yes, we constantly update our anticheat to actively identify and we try to block new cheats before they become popular among cheaters.

Q: Is Pegasus Free?
> A: No, it's an incredibly affordable offer for a lifetime access, available for that price only during the beta release days.

Q: Why can't an anticheat be free?
> A: Generally, I don't aim to profit from FiveM development. However, I understand that in the process of developing an anticheat and offering it for free to the community, it can pose a significant vulnerability for many servers. Servers that seek security might find that offering something for free can be easily exploited by anyone who desires it. This is why many anticheat solutions come with a price.

Q: Is it Open Source?
> A:Unfortunately, we cannot make our product open source at this time due to the issue of people reselling it without authorization. We believe that maintaining control over who can access and claim our product is essential to prevent misuse. However we are seeking your trust, which is why we utilize the Tebex escrow system, ensuring the safety of our files.
